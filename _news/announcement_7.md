I'm happy to share that that I got Spinger awards from Politecnico di Milano. 
This is an annual award for the **best 10-12 PhD theses** of the year for the **Information Technology** program, consisting of the research track of **Computer Science and Engineering**, **Telecommunications**, **Electronics**, and **System and Control**. A summary of the thesis will be published as a book chapter and appear in theSpringer book series ”Special Topics in Information Technology”

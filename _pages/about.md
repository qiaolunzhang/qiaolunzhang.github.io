I am an assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMI), Italy. I received my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. Besides, I received a double master's degree from SJTU and PoliMI. I obtained my PHD degree with **cum laude** under supervision of Prof. [Massimo Tornatore](https://tornatore.faculty.polimi.it/) from Politecnico di Milano. 
I also worked with Dr. [Patricia Layec](https://www.nokia.com/blog/author/patricia-layec/) in Nokia Bell Labs France as an assistant optical networking researcher in 2023.
I visited the Quantum Information Team with Prof. [Eleni Diamanti](https://largo.lip6.fr/~ediamanti/research.html) and Prof. [Frédéric Grosshans](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VtYIPU4AAAAJ&hl=en) in Sorbonne University for 3 months in 2024. 

My research interests cover a broad spectrum of topics in resource allocation for communications networks, which a focus on optimization and machine learning approaches. My research objective is to build a high-performance, green, and intelligent network foundation to support the exponential scaling of AI and the evolution of future communication systems. My research is focused on the following two aspects:

- Network for AI | Distributed Training & Distributed Inference Support
  - Collective optimization for LLM training
  - Edge-Cloud collaborative LLM inference
  - Energy efficiency for AI services with satellites

- AI for Network| Intelligent Network Optimization and Management
  - Multi-agent network management
  - AI&Optimization for classical and quantum network design and optimization
